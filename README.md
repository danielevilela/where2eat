The program will accept a user location as a pair of coordinates and returns a list of the five closest restaurants, along with the cheapest dish price for each restaurant

The distance between two points will be computed as the Manhattan distance

Using Maven, you can run the application using:

mvn spring-boot:run

Ps.: The app is not ready :(
